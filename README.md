# HCPCS_Cd-Code-Usage By Denis Prokhoda

  Welcome to the GitHub repository for our comprehensive analysis of Evaluation and Management (E&M) CPT coding practices in various Central Florida counties. This project aims to shed light on the complexities of medical coding practices, unraveling insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of regional healthcare trends.

1) Data Source:

Our primary dataset is sourced from Medicare Physician and Other Practitioners Provider Summary - (https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-physician-other-practitioners/medicare-physician-other-practitioners-by-provider-and-service) available through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). This dataset provides a rich foundation for exploring E&M coding patterns.

2)Task Our project is twofold:

*Analysis of E&M CPT Coding Practices: We extensively analyze E&M coding practices in the Central Florida counties of Volusia, Flagler, Seminole, Brevard, St. Johns, Marion, and Putnam. We aim to uncover these areas' trends, patterns, and potential variations.

*1-Page Visualization and Storytelling: As part of our analysis, we create a concise yet informative 1-page visualization that tells the story hidden within the data. This visualization encapsulates key insights and trends, making the information accessible and engaging.

3)Artifacts:

* 1-Page Narrative of Methods. In this document, we have outlined the methodologies used in our analysis. This narrative provides a transparent and comprehensive view of our approach, from data preprocessing to analytical techniques.

* 1-Page Summary of Findings. This brief document encapsulates the outcomes of our analysis. It distills the complexities of E&M coding practices into a concise summary, highlighting significant trends and potential implications.

* Visualization in Power BI. Our Power BI visualization serves as a dynamic visual representation of our findings. This interactive visualization aids in understanding the data-driven narrative and allows users to explore the insights on their terms. 4)Python Code for Data Manipulation For those interested in the technical aspects, we provide Python code that demonstrates the steps taken to clean, organize, and manipulate the dataset. This code is intended to enhance transparency and facilitate reproducibility.

4)Resources:

For a more comprehensive understanding of E&M coding practices and their broader context, we recommend exploring the following resources:

American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) - Coding and Payment - (https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/practice-and-career/getting-paid/coding/evaluation-management.html)
